## Seeding the Menu

To populate the menu with all items and their image URLs, run the following command from the backend directory:

```
node seedMenu.js
```

This will connect to your MongoDB and insert or update all menu items as defined in the script. You can edit `seedMenu.js` to adjust prices, descriptions, or add more items as needed.
